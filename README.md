# RBTray2

RBTray2 is a small Windows program that runs in the background and allows almost any window to be minimized to the system tray by:

- Right-Clicking its minimize button
- Shift-Right-Clicking on its title bar
- Using the Windows-Alt-Down hotkey

Note that not all of these methods will work for every window, so please use whichever one works for your needs.

RBTray2 is free, open source, and is distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public Licence](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

## Download

- [64 bit binaries](x64)
- [32 bit binaries](x86)
- [Original RBTray](http://sourceforge.net/projects/RBTray/files/)

## Installing

Download either the 32-bit or 64-bit binaries (depending on your OS) to a folder,
for example "C:\Program Files\RBTray2".  Double click RBTray2.exe to start it.  If
you want it to automatically start after you reboot, create a shortcut to RBTray2.exe
in your Start menu's Startup group.

## Using

To minimize a program to the system tray, you can use any of these methods:

- Right-click with the mouse on the program's minimize button.
- Hold the Shift key while Right-clicking on the program's title bar.
- Pressing Windows-Alt-Down on the keyboard (all at the same time).

This should create an icon for the window in the system tray. To restore the
program's window, single-click the program's icon in the tray. Alternatively,
you can Right-click on the tray icon which should bring up a popup menu, then
select Restore Window.

## Exiting

Right click on any tray icon created by RBTray2 and click Exit RBTray2 in the
popup menu, or run RBTray2.exe with the `--exit` parameter.
